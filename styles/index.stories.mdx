# Dansdata Style Guide

The design for the Dansdata portal is based on [Material Design 3](https://m3.material.io/).

The project uses [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling and
[Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/) for icons.

Since there are not yet any Material Design 3 compatible component frameworks available,
I decided to add components using tailwindcss based on the guidelines and project needs.
This is probably a bad idea (considering the extra work), but now I'm commited.

## Design Tokens

This project tries to stay true to Material Design 3, which includes the use of
[design tokens](https://m3.material.io/foundations/design-tokens/overview).

Shortforms are acceptable when warranted (e.g. `bg-primary` instead of
`bg-md-sys-color-primary`) but the long version should preferably still be declared.

I admit this policy is due to lack of experience on my part.

## Assets

See the [design repository](https://github.com/dansdata-se/design) for design assets.
