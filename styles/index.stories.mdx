# Dansdata Style Guide

The design for the Dansdata portal is based on [Material Design 3](https://m3.material.io/).

The project uses [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling and
[Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/) for icons.

Since there are not yet any Material Design 3 compatible component frameworks available,
I decided to add components using tailwindcss based on the guidelines and project needs.
This is probably a bad idea (considering the extra work), but now I'm commited.

## Design Tokens

This project tries to stay true to Material Design 3, which includes the use of
[design tokens](https://m3.material.io/foundations/design-tokens/overview).

It's preferable to use the full token name for css variables and to use a shorter
(though still identifiable) version for tailwind classes.

I admit the flaws in this policy are due to lack of experience on my part.

## Assets
