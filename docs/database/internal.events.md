# internal.events

## Description

A collection of event_groups, in turn containing individual event_slots.  
  
"event" is a top-level abstraction, typically symbolizing the entirety of e.g. "Dansbandveckan i Malung".  
  
An event can be split into groups, typically symbolizing e.g. the day, a group of people or something else.  
It is up to the event organizer to create appropriate groupings for their specific event.  
  
Each group in the event can be further subdivided into individual "slots". The slot symbolizes an individual  
e.g. dance or course session.
