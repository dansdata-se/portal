# internal.event_organizers

## Description

Determines which profiles are considered organizers of a given event.  
  
Any user that is considered an owner of an organizing profile may edit the event in question.  
  
Example:  
  
"John" creates an event and adds the "Phantastico" band profile as an organizer. Since "Jane" is one of the `profile_owners`  
for the "Phantastico" band, she also receives edit access
